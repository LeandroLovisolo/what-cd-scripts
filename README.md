#Hacky What.CD Scripts

`freeleech.py` - Downloads all current freeleech torrents from What.CD

Requirements: BeautifulSoup

Currently far from perfect. Thinking of adding multithreading to the download phase but have no idea on how that might turn out, also want to make it figure out how many pages there currently are by itself.

    ==================================================
    Usage: freeleech.py [OPTION]
    What.CD freeleech downloader

    -l/--login user:password, override default login
    -q/--quiet go silent
    -h/--help this message
